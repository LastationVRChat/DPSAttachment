# DPSAttachment
Simple prefab to simplify the process of attaching DPS orifices and rings to VRChat avatar 3.0.
Made for use with Dynamic Penetration System by Raliv https://raliv.booth.pm/items/2825903

Using only 1 orifice and 1 ring with parent constraints you can cover a wide range of possible penetration points. The lights of the orifices have been optimized to minimize clashing with other DPS in the scene.
